### 2025-10-13 - Frontend Routing & Layout Implementation
- Created NOTES.md to track project progress and maintain context between Claude Code sessions
- **Completed routing and navigation setup:**
  - Created main application layout with header and collapsible sidebar
  - Implemented routing in `app.routes.ts` with lazy loading for all features
  - Created feature routing modules for products and reports
  - Updated app.component to use router outlet
- **Implemented Dashboard:**
  - Created dashboard component with today's sales and low stock metrics
  - Added quick action buttons for common tasks (POS, Products, Reports)
  - Styled with modern card-based design
- **Completed Product Form:**
  - Full CRUD form for creating and editing products
  - Reactive forms with validation
  - Category dropdown (using mock data for now)
  - SKU is read-only in edit mode
  - Stock quantity read-only in edit mode (managed via inventory)
- **Wired up Product List:**
  - Connected Add and Edit buttons to navigation
  - Products can now be created, edited, and deleted via UI
- Application successfully compiles and runs on http://localhost:4201/

## Current Tasks
- [x] Setup routing and navigation
- [x] Create layout with header and sidebar
- [x] Implement product form component
- [x] Create dashboard component
- [x] Test application compilation
- [x] Integrate PrimeNG UI framework
- [x] Update CORS for backend connection
- [x] Create CategoryService and connect to API

## Next Steps
1. **Test Backend Integration:**
   - Start backend API server
   - Test all CRUD operations with real data
   - Verify category dropdown loads from API
2. **Inventory Management:**
   - Implement inventory list component
   - Create inventory adjustment form
4. **Reports Module:**
   - Implement sales report component with date filters
   - Add charts/visualizations
5. **UI Improvements:**
   - Consider adding Angular Material or PrimeNG for better UI components
   - Add loading spinners
   - Add toast notifications for success/error messages
6. **Authentication:**
   - Implement login page
   - Add JWT token management
   - Create auth guard for routes

## Important Decisions
- Using Angular 17 standalone components (no modules)
- Lazy loading all feature components for better performance
- PrimeNG 17 for UI components with Lara Light Blue theme
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Forms use Reactive Forms approach
- Application runs on port 4201 (backend supports both 4200 and 4201)
- Backend API at http://localhost:5000

## Issues/Blockers
- Backend API needs to be running for full functionality
- Inventory components are empty placeholders
- Reports components are empty placeholders
- POS component needs PrimeNG update for consistency
- No authentication implemented yet
