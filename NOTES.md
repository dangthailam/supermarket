# SuperMarket Project Notes

## Session History

### 2025-10-17 - Excel Import Integration & Git Repository Setup
- **Excel Product Import System:**
  - Analyzed Excel file (DanhSachSanPham_KV17102025-132919-053.xlsx) with 3,839 products and 32 columns
  - Extended Product model with new fields to match Excel structure:
    * ProductType (Loại hàng), Brand (Thương hiệu), Unit (ĐVT)
    * MaxStockLevel (Tồn lớn nhất), Weight (Trọng lượng), Location (Vị trí)
    * DirectSalesEnabled (Được bán trực tiếp), PointsEnabled (Tích điểm)
  - Updated all DTOs (ProductDto, CreateProductDto, UpdateProductDto) with new fields
  - Updated ProductService to map new fields in CRUD operations
  - Created ExcelImportService with EPPlus library
  - Added API endpoint: POST /api/products/import-excel
  - Automatic category creation/mapping from "Nhóm hàng" column
  - Handles both new products (insert) and existing products (update) based on SKU
  - Comprehensive error handling and import result reporting
- **Database Migration:**
  - Created and applied migration for new Product fields
  - Fixed dynamic DateTime initialization issues across all models
  - Updated DbContext with proper column configurations for new fields
- **Git Repository:**
  - Created comprehensive .gitignore for .NET and Angular projects
  - Configured git with user credentials (Dang Thai Lam <lamtp1989@gmail.com>)
  - Created initial commit with complete project structure
  - Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/dangthailam/supermarket.git
- **Testing Tools:**
  - Created Python test script (test-import.py) for API testing
  - Created TestImport.cs for direct database import testing
- **Excel Column Mapping:**
  - Mã hàng → SKU, Tên hàng → Name, Mã vạch → Barcode
  - Giá bán → Price, Giá vốn → CostPrice
  - Tồn kho → StockQuantity, Tồn nhỏ nhất → MinStockLevel, Tồn lớn nhất → MaxStockLevel
  - Nhóm hàng → Category (auto-created), Hình ảnh → ImageUrl
  - Plus all new fields (Brand, Unit, Weight, Location, etc.)

### 2025-10-14 - PrimeNG Integration & Backend Connection
- **Integrated PrimeNG UI Framework:**
  - Installed PrimeNG 17 with Lara Light Blue theme
  - Updated Layout with PrimeNG Sidebar, Menu, and Buttons
  - Converted Product List to use PrimeNG Table, Card, Toast, ConfirmDialog, Tags, and Tooltips
  - Converted Product Form to use PrimeNG InputText, InputNumber, Dropdown, Checkbox, and Buttons
  - Updated Dashboard with PrimeNG Cards and Buttons
  - Full mobile-first responsive design
- **Backend Integration:**
  - Updated CORS to allow port 4201
  - Created Categories API controller
  - Created CategoryService in frontend
  - Replaced mock categories with real API data
- **Application now has:**
  - Professional mobile-first UI
  - Full PrimeNG component library integrated
  - Backend API connected and ready for testing

### 2025-10-13 - Frontend Routing & Layout Implementation
- Created NOTES.md to track project progress and maintain context between Claude Code sessions
- **Completed routing and navigation setup:**
  - Created main application layout with header and collapsible sidebar
  - Implemented routing in `app.routes.ts` with lazy loading for all features
  - Created feature routing modules for products and reports
  - Updated app.component to use router outlet
- **Implemented Dashboard:**
  - Created dashboard component with today's sales and low stock metrics
  - Added quick action buttons for common tasks (POS, Products, Reports)
  - Styled with modern card-based design
- **Completed Product Form:**
  - Full CRUD form for creating and editing products
  - Reactive forms with validation
  - Category dropdown (using mock data for now)
  - SKU is read-only in edit mode
  - Stock quantity read-only in edit mode (managed via inventory)
- **Wired up Product List:**
  - Connected Add and Edit buttons to navigation
  - Products can now be created, edited, and deleted via UI
- Application successfully compiles and runs on http://localhost:4201/

## Current Tasks
- [x] Setup routing and navigation
- [x] Create layout with header and sidebar
- [x] Implement product form component
- [x] Create dashboard component
- [x] Test application compilation
- [x] Integrate PrimeNG UI framework
- [x] Update CORS for backend connection
- [x] Create CategoryService and connect to API
- [x] Analyze Excel file and map columns to Product model
- [x] Extend Product model with new fields
- [x] Create Excel import service and API endpoint
- [x] Create database migration for new fields
- [x] Setup Git repository and .gitignore
- [x] Push code to GitHub

## Next Steps
1. **Test Excel Import:**
   - Start backend API server
   - Import the Excel file with 3,839 products
   - Verify all products and categories are created correctly
   - Test update functionality with modified Excel file
2. **Update Frontend for New Product Fields:**
   - Update Product model in Angular to include new fields
   - Update Product Form to include Brand, Unit, Weight, Location, etc.
   - Update Product List to display new fields
3. **Excel Import UI (Optional):**
   - Create Angular component for file upload
   - Add progress indicator during import
   - Display import results (imported, updated, skipped, errors)
4. **Inventory Management:**
   - Implement inventory list component
   - Create inventory adjustment form
   - Connect to inventory API endpoints
5. **Reports Module:**
   - Implement sales report component with date filters
   - Add charts/visualizations using PrimeNG Chart
6. **Authentication:**
   - Implement login page
   - Add JWT token management
   - Create auth guard for routes

## Important Decisions
- Using Angular 17 standalone components (no modules)
- Lazy loading all feature components for better performance
- PrimeNG 17 for UI components with Lara Light Blue theme
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Forms use Reactive Forms approach
- Application runs on port 4201 (backend supports both 4200 and 4201)
- Backend API at http://localhost:5000
- EPPlus library for Excel file processing
- Excel import supports both insert and update based on SKU
- Automatic category creation during Excel import
- Git repository: https://github.com/dangthailam/supermarket.git

## Issues/Blockers
- Excel import not yet tested with actual data (need to run backend and import)
- Frontend Product model doesn't include new fields yet
- Product Form UI doesn't include new fields (Brand, Unit, Weight, etc.)
- Inventory components are empty placeholders
- Reports components are empty placeholders
- POS component needs PrimeNG update for consistency
- No authentication implemented yet
